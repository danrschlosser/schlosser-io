<p>In September 2020, I left The Times to start Ambrook with two long-time friends, <a href="https://twitter.com/ciaomack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mackenzie</a> and <a href="https://jhil.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff</a>. At Ambrook, we help farmers and ranchers find farm funding. Our first products include a searchable <a href="https://ambrook.ag/funding" target="_blank">farm funding library</a> with over 200 grants, loans, and other financial assistance. We also help automate the application process, removing the hassle of dealing with complex paperwork and processes.</p>
