<section class="text">
    <p>In the last few days of summer, I escaped from New York to Chile with my friend Yih-Jen, meeting up with our San Francisco-based friends Jeff and Emily in a shared layover in Atlanta. The trip, while fantastic, was admittably poorly timed. After planning the getaway months earlier, I later made plans for two other international summer trips: <a href="/travel/israel-jerusalem-summer-2019/">Israel and Jerusalem in June</a> and <a href="/travel/japan-summer-2019/">Japan in August</a>. By the end of the summer, I was a bit tired of the travel, and feeling behind on work. (It was performance review season at work, just to top it off.)</p>
    <p>By all reasonable logic, the trip should have been exhausting. A twelve hour flight, multiple cities, car rentals, some late-night domestic flights, and several days in the middle of the desert. Despite all of that, I found my time in Chile regenerative. The cultural history in Santiago, the vibrancy of Valparaíso, and the diversity of landscape in San Pedro de Atacama each gave me a different kind of energy. Plus, a great group of friends will make any trip worthwhile.</p>

    <h2>Santiago</h2>
    <p>To make things easy, we split up the planning of our trip by section: I was in charge of the restaurants, museums, and other site seeing in the cities (Santiago and Valparaíso), and Jeff led the nature sites in San Pedro. While I did a fair amount of research, much of our time in Santiago was spontaneous.</p>

    <h2>Valparaíso</h2>
    <p>After just a day in Santiago, we drove west to the coast, where we spent two days and a night in Valparaíso. Sprawling across a series of hills and bursting with color, the city reminded me of a mix between <a href="/travel/peru-fall-2017/#miraflores">Miraflores, Peru</a> and <a href="/travel/ireland-uk-summer-2016/#edinburgh">Edinburgh, Scotland</a>. We stayed at a beautiful Airbnb perched at the top of a hill, an experience I'd recommend to anyone visiting the city.</p>

    <p>On our way to the Santiago airport, we stopped through Viña del Mar to check out the massive sand dunes that line the coast, north of Valparaíso. With the burning hot ground, shoes were a must, but I spent ages getting sand out of them.</p>

    <h2>San Pedro de Atacama</h2>
    <p>After a 90-minute flight from Santiago, we landed in Calama and drove an hour east to San Pedro de Atacama, a high-altitude (7900') desert town. From San Pedro, we spent three days exploring the mountains, valleys, and flats. Before visiting, my impression of the Atacama desert was that it would be similar to other deserts I'd seen in TV and movies. I imagined sand like in the Sahara and brutally hot temperatures. What we discovered, though, was a diverse set of landscapes. Salt flats, spiky mountain ranges, high-altitude lakes, and, yes, an occasional sand dune. </p>

    <p>On our last day in Valparaíso, we drove up into another set of mountains, this time north of San Pedro. Our agenda was simple: geysers, hot springs, and flamingos. We saw all three, although my photos of the latter are horrible.</p>

    <h2>Santiago</h2>
    <p>Our last two days in the country were spent in Santiago. We spent most of our time hopping between museums, cafés, and restaurants. Not a bad way to end a trip! Our first stop was to the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, which commemorates the victims of human rights violations committed by the nationalist military dictatorship between 1973 and 1990. The museum, while challenging, was extremely educational and well designed. I highly recommend the audio guide for non-Spanish speakers.</p>
