<section class="text">
    <p>After I graduate from college, I spent two months traveling around Europe. I spent the first two weeks with friends in <a href="/travel/italy-croatia-summer-2016">Italy and Croatia</a> and the second two weeks by myself in <a href="/travel/france-spain-summer-2016/">France and Spain</a>.  After my time in Spain, I flew to Ireland, where I began two weeks traveling across the British Isles, in Dublin.</p>
    <p>There, I met up with Yih-Jen, a friend from school who was also traveling around Europe at the time.  We shared a camera for the duration of our trip, so some photos were taken by him, and others by me. Together, we explored Dublin, Galway, and the Irish island Inishmore, as well as London, Brighton, and Edinburgh.</p>

    <h2>Dublin</h2>
    <h3>Boston, but Older</h3>
    <p>My first stop in Ireland was Dublin, a beautiful town with way more to do than I got the chance to. We went on a tour of the Guinness factory, and saw a play, but what I enjoyed the most was just walking around the city and seeing the architecture and cultural landmarks. It's an embarrassing viewpoint, but having grown up outside Boston it reminded me a lot of home.  (For good reason, knowing Boston's history.)  It was clear that Dublin had way more history than Boston did, with older churches and cobblestone streets, but the organization, terrain, and design of the city were very reminiscent.</p>

    <p>I also got a chance to get a taste of Dublin's theater scene.  Yih-Jen and I got tickets to Once, the musical, which was stunning.  The actors were also the orchestra, playing instruments both in and out of character. If I went back to Dublin, I'd make sure to see another play or musical; it was one of the most rewarding things we did in town.</p>

    <h2>Galway</h2>
    <h3>Quintessential Irish Countryside</h3>
    <p>After spending a few days in Dublin, Yih-Jen and I took a train west to Galway, a beautiful city on a bay in west Ireland. It's a small town, with a few cute restaurants and shops, but not much to speak of beyond that. Unlike in Dublin, where we saw plays, went to pubs, and went on historical tours, in Galway we spent most of our time exploring the Irish countryside. In just a few days, we got to explore the town center, tour the Burren (a nearby national park), and the Cliffs of Moor. Galway and the surrounding countryside were some of the most beautiful places I visited on my trip.</p>

    <h2>Inishmore</h2>
    <h3>An Island Paradise</h3>
    <p>On our third day in Galway, we took a day trip to the Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands, a cluster of pasture-covered rocks off the coast of west Ireland. There's a ferry from the Galway docks, but we decided to opt for a more glamorous entrance, by plane. We took a morning shuttle to an tiny airport half an hour down the coast, with exclusive service to Inishmore. We packed into this tiny 10-person plane, and took off towards the islands.  We were only in the air for about 20 minutes, landing smoothly on the Islands only airstrip.</p>

    <h2>London</h2>
    <h3>The Other Metropolis</h3>
    <p>After an amazing stay in Ireland, we flew to London, where we spent a week exploring the museums, neighborhoods, and tea houses. It was pretty rainy (as is to be expected), but we managed to make our way everywhere we wanted to go without getting too wet.  Our daily routine was essentially a rotation between food, tea, and some tourist attraction on endless repeat.  Breakfast, tea, a museum, lunch, tea, a park, etc. Of everywhere I visited, London felt the most familiar. It was like New York City, but older and more tight-lipped. In contrast with Ireland, which gave me time to enjoy nature, London was a return to modern life.</p>

    On our last night in London, we took the tube to Bank and crossed the Millennium Bridge, a pedestrian-only bridge that crosses the river Thames. On the other side sits the Tate Modern museum, which we got into just before closing.  We weren't there long, but we got a chance to take the elevator to the observation deck, which has amazing views of the city.

    <h2>Brighton</h2>

    <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
    <h3>A City on a Hill</h3>
    <p>We flew out of London into Edinburgh, Scotland, where we met up with my mom. It was the last stop in my trip that Yih-Jen and I did together, and my second-to-last stop overall (I flew to Iceland afterwards with my mom). The city of Edinburgh is organized around the hill on which Edinburgh castle sits. We stayed in Grassmarket, a neighborhood in the valley below the central hill.</p>
