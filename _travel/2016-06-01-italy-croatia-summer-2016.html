    <p>After I graduated from College, I set out on the longest trip of my life to date. Two months, visiting twenty-four cities in eight countries. It wasn't my first time in Europe, but it was my first time visiting each city in my trip.</p>

    <p>In travelling for so long, my trip really felt like four smaller trips, each two weeks.  The first, I spent with friends in Italy and Croatia, the second by myself in France and Spain, the third with a friend in the UK, and the last with my mom in Iceland.</p>

    <p>My original plan was to start in Barcelona, and make my way north and east, but after finding an amazingly priced ticket from Boston to Rome, I flipped everything around.</p>

    <h2>Rome</h2>
    <h3>Tourist Central</h3>
    <p>Rome was by far the most overwhelming city I visited, and it was appropriate to be my first stop.  I was only there for a three days, but I managed to to pack in a crazy amount of sightseeing, shopping, and tasting in that time.</p>
    <p>I spent my entire first day in Rome at the Vatican Museum and St. Peter's Basilica. Even so, there was plenty I didn't get to see. What I did see, though, was completely stunning.</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>The Vatican Museum is one big loop. If you go quickly, you could probably get through the whole thing in four or five hours, but if you take your time, it can easily take more than a day.  For the most part, it was packed.  However, there was an occasional side room or two that would be more calm.</p>
    <p>The path leads through many different time periods and collections: sculpture, tapestry, cartography, and more. It's a stunning reminder of how powerful the Roman Empire was.</p>

    <p>I spent the majority of my time in Rome visiting all the touristy hot spots. With only a few days, that was all I had time for.  (That and lots of pasta, mind you.)  The Colosseum was really stunning, and is still is the centerpiece of Rome. Wandering around, I always ended up bumping back into it.</p>
    <p>Although it's beautiful enough from the outside, I also got an opportunity to tour the inside in a nighttime tour. While it was probably overpriced, it was neat to get to go into the basement of the building and see where they kept the animals, food, and sets. I didn't know this before touring, but apparently the Romans had a knack for exotic sets for their battles and had even designed a contraption to raise combatants up through a trap door in the arena into battle. An ancient elevator!</p>

    <h2>Dubrovnik</h2>
    <h3>A Fortress on the Water</h3>
    <p>After visiting Rome, we headed across the Adriatic Sea to Croatia, where we visited Dubrovnik and Split. After Croatia I would actually fly back to Italy to see Venice, but it was actually more affordable to fly out of Italy and back in.</p>
    <p>Dubrovnik was probably the biggest surprise of my entire trip. I didn't have very high expectations for Croatia. I hadn't heard much about it, but a few strong recommendations from friends put in on my list. That said, it was definitely a highlight of my trip: beautiful cliffsides, beaches, and towns, inexpensive food and amenities, and friendly people.</p>
    <p>We spent most of our time in Dubrovnik, which is centered around the "Old Town," a pedestrian-only commercial district. The city sits right on the ocean, with tall stone walls built on top of the rocks.</p>

    <p>A few days into our stay, we rented a private speedboat tour of the nearby islands. It sounds excessive, but the entire day (five hours plus time for lunch on Island restaurant) only ran us &euro;50 each. Our guide picked us up at a nearby beach, and took us to several islands, where we got a chance to swim in caves, hike trails, and relax.</p>

    <p>I would highly recommend visiting Dubrovnik to anyone interested. It wasn't as historic or magnificent as Rome or Venice, but it was beautiful and relaxing. After the intensity of my first stop it was exactly what I wanted.</p>

    <h2>Split</h2>
    <h3>A Beautiful City Three Hours North</h3>
    <p>After a few days in Dubrovnik, we rented a car and drove three hours up the coast to Split, a larger coastal city with another pedestrian-only Old Town. The drive was amazing. You can get to Split from Dubrovnik by highway in about 2.5 hours if you wanted, but it's worth every minute to take the D8, a parallel route that winds along the coast.</p>

    <h2>Venice</h2>
    <h3>Just Feet Away From Becoming Atlantis</h3>
    <p>Visiting Venice was amazing.  It was certainly more touristy than Dubrovnik, but it lived up to the hype.  It's small enough and dense enough that a good majority of my time there was spent wandering around the city, counting bridges, canals, and gelato shops.</p>
    <p>We visited the tourist attractions: St. Mark's Square, Basilica, and Tower, but most of the time was spent exploring and wandering into smaller shops.</p>

    <p>To get the full Venice experience, Daniela and I took a gondola ride.  Even for just a half hour, it was completely worth it. Watching the gondolier duck under bridges and kick off walls was awesome.</p>
