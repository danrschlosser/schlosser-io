<section class="text">
    <p>A year ago, I visited Sydney for the first time. On that trip, given the first opportunity to explore that part of the world, I bolted <a href="/travel/australia-new-zealand-spring-2018/">straight to New Zealand</a>. While I don't regret the decision, I had to put off seeing more of Australia until my next visit.</p>

    <p>This Winter, I got that opportunity. After spending a week in Sydney for work, I met up with my friends Lily and Yih-Jen and we spent 10 days exploring the country. We hit the big tourist spots in Sydney, took a day trip to the Blue Mountains, and explored Tasmania. On our way home, we stopped in Melbourne for a short first visit.</p>

    <h2>Sydney</h2>
    <p>On my first visit to Sydney, I visited a few restaurants, went to a beach or two, and snapped a photo of the Opera House. Returning for my second visit, the first thing that struck me was the architecture. When I landed, I stopped into a cafe for tea, then walked around the neighborhood near my hotel, and took my first photos.</p>

    <p>Later in the week, Lily arrived in Sydney, a day before Yih-Jen. We booked ourselves a welcome dinner at <a href="https://www.bennelong.com.au/">Bennelong</a>, the restaurant located inside the Sydney Opera House. I'm not sure what was better, the food, the atmosphere, or the way the building is lit at night. We were both expecting a bit of a tourist trap, being located in the Opera House and all, but Bennelong is far from it.</p>

    <p>Early on in our trip, we booked a bus to take us to the Blue Mountains, a few hours outside Sydney. The morning of our tour, we had a few hours to kill, and we decide to splurge on short helicopter tour of the city. Departing from Sydney airport, the trip took us across the city, offering an aerial "greatest hits" of the city.</p>

    <h2>Tasmania</h2>
    <p>After a packed weekend in Sydney and the Blue Mountains, we hopped on an early morning plane to Hobart, Tasmania. I'm not sure how common a misconception it is, but when I first was recommended to visit Tasmania, I assumed it was a country of its own, like New Zealand. (In fact, it's an island state of Australia.) The flight, just two hours from Sydney, passed in no time, and we found ourselves zipping down the left (correct!) side of the two-lane highways, towards Port Arthur.</p>

    <p>That night, we drove back to Hobart, where we spent the rest of the day. We had planned a third day on Bruny Island, but, fearing getting stuck on the wrong side of the ferry during a forecasted thunderstorm, we canceled. Instead, we made impromptu plans to visit the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA). While the thunderstorm didn't really pan out to be much more than a drizzle, this was absolutely the right call.</p>
    <p>I quickly fell in love with MONA for it's architecture. Built mostly underground into the side of a hill, the building is at once unremarkable from the outside and stunning on the inside. Even more impressive was the exhibition and curation. My favorite pieces were several by James Turell, an American MacArthur Genius Grant-winning artist that works mostly with light and space. I first discovered him when I saw his <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/3098">site-specific installation</a> <em>Meeting</em> at MOMA PS1 in Long Island City. (Others may know him for his work creating the colorful rooms in Drake's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc">Hotline Bling music video</a>.) Unbeknownst to me, he also has several installations at MONA in Hobart, including <em>Event Horizon</em>, a room whose walls, ceiling, and floor all meld together into one seemingly never-ending space. His artworks rarely travel to other museums, and others do not allow photography, making me feel even more fortunate that we were able to make the trip to visit.</p>

    <h2>Melbourne</h2>
    <p>We left from Hobart early in the morning, headed to Melbourne. We quickly learned that with only two days left in our trip, we didn't have nearly enough time to get to see or do all the things we wanted to in the city. I wont let that happen on my next trip. In our brief time in Melbourne, we explored boutique shops, ate some great food, and enjoyed lots of street art.</p>

    <p>After barely 24 hours in Melbourne, we made our way Back to Syndey, Los Angeles, and finally New York. The trip was lots of fun, and showed me just how little I know about the country. I can't wait to go back!</p>
