    <p>After a chilly December in San Francisco, Daniela and I took advantage of discounted post-holiday plane tickets to spend a week traveling around the Big Island of Hawai'i. We explored the forests, volcanic rock, and beaches in a relaxing seven-day trip.</p>
    <p>After landing in Kona, we drove south on route 11, making our way towards the Volcano National Park, where we spent our first night. But before we got there, we stopped at a harbor in the south-east for a half-day snorkeling trip.</p>
    <p>We boarded the catamaran, and held on tight as the boat bounced on the choppy waves for a hour-long trip to the snorkeling spot. When we arrived, the water was much more placid, perfect for snorkeling. While we could see just fine, a significant portion of the coral reefs were whitened or gray from rising sea temperatures.</p>

    <h2>Volcano National Park</h2>
    <p>At the end of our first day, we made it to a bamboo forest in the south where we found our Airbnb. It was surreal. With a mix of rock and bamboo garden on the outside and paper doors and modern furnishings on the inside, the house was a fantastic mix of Japanese and American.</p>

    <h2>The Fruit Farm</h2>
    <p>When we left Volcano National Park, we drove west to the southwest corner of the Island. After making our way through PƒÅhoa, we turned off the main highway onto a dirt road, which we made our way down, at less than five miles and hour, for a full mile. Splashing through mud puddles and navigating around rocky, uneven ground, we made our way to the end of this road to a beautiful fruit farm.</p>
    <p>After meeting with our gracious hosts (the farmers), we walked through the biodynamic fruit garden on blanks, strewn on top of rocks, milk crates, and other improvised lifts. Feet free of excessive mud, we arrived at our next Airbnb: <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11239828">a cabin studio overlooking the farmland</a>.</p>

    <p>From the fruit farm, we went on several day trips, to forests, beaches, and pools. Our favorite was by far Ahalanui County Beach Park, where we swam in the volcanically heated seawater pools. The ocean water flows in through a small man-made channel, where it mixes with the heated water.</p>

    <p>On other days, we ventured north on a tour of nearby waterfalls. Some were right by the road, and others were further in, but none were more than an hour's drive from our cabin.</p>

    <p>We also had the opportunity of visiting Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden, a carefully crafted collection of tropical flowers, trees, and bushes. Carved into a seaside ravine, the garden was the life's work of Dan Lutkenhouse, and had a huge collection of different kinds of plants.</p>

    <p>On our last day, after checking out of our Airbnb, we headed across the Island to the northwest, where we'd spend the rest of our time. But on the way, we spent several hours hiking into Waipio Valley.</p>
    <p>Like many places along this coast, the road leads to the top of the valley, and any hiking involves walking down and then back up. While more fearful (or brave?) travelers paid to be driven in vans down the extremely steep road, we opted to walk. When we finally made our way back up, we were tired, but it was well worth the journey.</p>

    <h2>Back to Civilization</h2>
    <p>After all this time out in nature, we also needed some time at a hotel. We stayed in the Mauna Lani hotel in the west, which was right on the beach and whose lobby is a beautiful open courtyard.</p>

    <h5>We explored the seawater pools on the land adjacent to our hotel.</h5>

<section class="text">
    <p>While we spent most of our hotel time on the beach, we did venture outside the grounds for one special trip: a summit of Mauna Kea, the tallest mountain in Hawaii.</p>
    <p>You can drive up to the visitor center (elevation 9200 ft) with a normal car, but to get to the summit, you need a four-wheel drive car. We rented a Jeep Wrangler for the day, and made our way up. We stopped by the visitor information center to adjust to the altitude for about an hour or so, before turning on 4WD mode and heading up to the summit.</p>
    <p>It was an amazing view, and an amazing end to our otherworldly trip.</p>
