<section class="text">
    <p>In the summer after I graduated college, I took two months off, traveling across Europe. After spending two weeks in <a href="/travel/italy-croatia-summer-2016/">Italy and Croatia</a> with friends, I went solo, traveling in France and Spain for just over two weeks. First, I spent ten days in Paris, staying at hostels and Airbnbs, and then I flew to Spain, where I spent a week traveling around the country by train.</p>
    <p>Solo travel was completely new to me, and I'm really glad I got the opportunity to try it. In both France and Spain I entered the country with very few plans, and pretty much made it up as I went. It was liberating to have so few limitations imposed on me. (My only requirements were basic survival and general tourist pressure to see the Eiffel Tower.)</p>
    <p>At first, this freedom was sort of uncomfortable. I felt the need to have a plan out full days and keep a strict schedule. But after a few days, I settled in to moving at my own speed, content to skip or extend stops depending on my mood.</p>

    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <h3>An Artist's Paradise</h3>
    <p>I loved being in Paris. I'm not sure if it was the city or just my mood, but my week in Paris was by far the most laid back part of my trip. I spent ten days wandering around the city, frequenting pastry shops, other restaurants, museums, and parks. The only thing I "had" to see was the Eiffel Tower, which was well worth the visit, despite my fear of being overly touristy. A more enterprising traveler could have easily seen what I saw of Paris and also had time for day trips to the countryside (I considered a few), but instead I went slow, taking time to appreciate everything the city had to offer.</p>

    <p>My only fully-scheduled day in Paris was my visit to the Louvre Museum. I decided early on that I wanted to spend an entire day there, as to not rush through any exhibits. I'm really glad that I did. There are a lot of museums about which people will say "Oh, you could spend an entire day there and still not see everything!" For the most part, this is exaggeration. But for the Louvre it's absolutely true. It is one the most beautiful museums, with a collection that easily entertained me for an entire day.</p>

    <p>I saw thousands of pieces of art across dozens of exhibits, across multiple styles and time periods. I'm especially a sucker for sculpture, and the Louvre didn't disappoint.  One of the most beautiful rooms in the entire museum was a three-story glassed-in courtyard where the majority of their Greek and Roman sculpture sits.</p>

    <h2>Barcelona</h2>
    <h3>My First Taste of Spain</h3>
    <p>After staying put for so long in Paris, I flew to Barcelona where I kicked off a 10-day train trip around Spain. I spent two nights in Barcelona, one in Valencia, three in Seville, and five in Madrid with a day trip to Toledo. With so little time in each city, I definitely didn't get to do them justice, but I glad to get a feel for each city.</p>
    <p>Barcelona was very upbeat and lively.  I didn't spend any time at the beach, but I would have if I had stayed longer.  With my time allotted, I managed to visit a few museums and landmarks I was looking forward to.</p>

    <h2>Valencia</h2>
    <h3>A Glimpse of the Future</h3>
    <p>I can barely say in good conscience that I really visited Valencia. I was only in town for one night, and with my train schedule, I didn't get in early enough to get into the one place I intended on visiting: The City of Arts and Sciences. Unfortunately, I didn't get there in time to see the inside of the Museum, but I was able to tour this amazing set of buildings.</p>

    <h2>Seville</h2>
    <h3>Religious History in Architecture</h3>
    <p>After my night in Valencia, I took the high speed train to Seville, for what was definitely my favorite stop in Spain. Seville is an amazing city with a perfect balance of beautiful architecture and sight-seeing and great bars and tapas restaurants. I was lucky to find a great hostel, where my hosts connected us to a free walking tour of the city, took us out to bars, and gave us tips on the best places to eat. I was only in Seville for two days, which wasn't nearly enough.</p>
    <p>Our guide explained how over the course of Seville's history, it was under control of Christian, Islamic, and Jewish communities, and the architectures of these religions are all visible across the city. As different communities took over the city, they found the old architecture so beautiful that they would leave it and convert or adapt it to their own purposes. This intersection of cultures forms the <em>Mudéjar</em> architectural style.</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>The prime example of Moorish architecture in Seville is the Royal Alcázar, a 16th-century royal palace with a completely tiled interior and beautiful walled-in garden. Exploring all the different rooms of the palace and all of the different corners of the garden took hours. There are signs of Christian, Islamic, and Jewish influence in the palace design.</p>

    <h2>Madrid</h2>
    <h3>The New Capital</h3>
    <p>After leaving Seville, I headed to Madrid, Spain's capital. By the time I got to Spain, I was pretty spent. I didn't get a chance to check out any of Madrid's nightlife or party scene, although I've heard great things. Next time! What I did get to enjoy was a young, modern city. Everything felt recent, from the statues to the plazas to the churches.</p>
