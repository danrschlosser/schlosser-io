<section class="text">
    <p>Just a few short weeks after graduating college, I set out on a two month trip to Europe.  I had the opportunity to enjoy new places, people, food, and to spend time with friends, family, and alone with myself. After spending time in Italy, Croatia, France, Spain, and the British Isles, the last stop on my trip was to Iceland. There, mom and I spent ten days driving around the Ring Road, a two-lane highway which circumvents the island.</p>

    <p>Our trip was not just tourism, however.  I made the trip to Iceland in order to meet several families worth of cousins that until recently, our family had not known even existed! My mom's great grandmother, Sigridur lived on a farm in East Iceland. After her first husband died, she remarried. Some years later they emigrated to North Dakota with their only living son&mdash;my great grandfather, Egil who was four years old when they moved in 1884.</p>

    <p>Egil married my great grandmother Polly, whose family had lived just up the fjord in Iceland!  Yet Sigridur's U.S. and Iceland families lost contact over the years, even though the descendents of Egil in the U.S. knew all about Polly's family in Iceland.</p>

    <p>Sigridur left her grown son, Sigurdur (don't get confused now!) from her first marriage in Iceland on the farm in Berunes (in the east). The cousins that I met in Iceland were the descendants of Sigurdur. His granddaughter, Hanna and her husband tracked down the Icelanders that left for the US, and with the help of her niece, Elsa, contacted my mother. After meeting them for the first time on a trip to Iceland in 2012, my mom flew with me from Scotland to Reykjavík to introduce me to my Icelandic relatives.</p>

    <h2>Reykjavík</h2>
    <h3>Meeting Long-Lost Family</h3>
    <p>When we arrived in Reykjavík, we picked up our rental car and drove to Aldis and Eystein's house. They are my mom's second cousins, older because of generational shifts, and grandparents to several young children. In the morning, they treated us to an amazing breakfast and tea, where we had the opportunity to meet many cousins of all ages. Coincidentally, we also intersected that day with my mom's first cousin's daughter Laura, who was just concluding a hiking trip with her boyfriend in Iceland!</p>

    <h2>Snæfellsnes</h2>
    <h3>The Western Peninsula</h3>
    <p>While our path around the ring road would be counterclockwise from Reykjavík (southwest Iceland), we first drove north west, to the Snæfellsnes peninsula. With the guidance of my cousin Börkur and his parents Hanna and Sigurbjörn, we got a first taste of the beautiful and unique Icelandic terrain. Our first stop was at the <a href="http://english.landnam.is/">The Settlement Center</a> in Borgarnes, where we got to learn more about the founding of Iceland by Egil (pronounced: Ale).</p>

    <p>Next, we stopped at Deildartunguhver, a vent for Iceland's plentiful hot spring water. In west Iceland, hot water is so plentiful that hot water faucets use the spring water directly, and the cold water faucets are artificially chilled!</p>

    <p>Next, we headed to Hraunfosar, the first of many waterfalls we saw on our trip. Hraunfosar is famous for the web of falls that sneak into the river from the bushes like tributaries into the main river. Just upstream a few feet is Barnafoss, a raging current with the remnants of a natural stone bridge. Börkur explained that a long while back, two local children fell off the bridge while trying to cross the river. Their mother had the natural bridge demolished.  Today, a man-made bridge crosses the stream just a few feet away from where the natural bridge used to exist.</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>The next day, we drove west, to a small coastal village called Hellnar, where we had lunch and explored a beautiful rock beach and rock formation. There's a surreal trail from Hellnar to a the next town over that weaves between rolling rocky hills formed from lava years before.</p>
    <p>Iceland is a fairly mountainous country, with only the small flat areas by the ocean being habitable.  As a result, the ring road often hugs the inland mountains, creating a drastic dichotomy between the farmland and sea on one side, and a sharp rising hill or mountain on the other. Driving around Snæfellsnes was stunning, with the mountain tops disappearing into the clouds just feet away from the farmland.</p>

    <h2>The Golden Circle</h2>
    <h3>The Best Day-Trip from Reykjavík</h3>
    <p>After returning to Rekyjavik from Snæfellsnes, we took a loop around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle_(Iceland)">Golden Circle</a>, day-long loop inland from Reykjavík. On it, we got some great farm-to-table food at Efsti-Dalur I, history, sights, and relaxation.</p>
    <p>Our first stop was the World Heritage site, Þingvellir (or Thingvellir), a vally that was the meeting place from 930-1798 for the AlÞing (or Althing), the national parliament of Iceland.</p>

    <p>Our last stop, where the were unfortunately no photos, was at the Secret Lagoon, a natural, open-air hot spring where we got to float and relax around in the pool for an hour or so to end our long day. It wasn't our first time in a hot spring (nor our last), but it definitely took the cake for best atmosphere. The pool ran right up to a rocky vent, that was too hot to even approach!</p>

<section class="text">
    <h2>Þórsmörk</h2>
    <h3>"Thor's Mork"</h3>
    <p>Probably the most magnificent part of our trip around Iceland was the day we spent in Þórsmörk, a national park surrounding a massive riverbed. Together with my third cousin Elsa, her daughter Kristborg, and one of her friends from school, my mom and I drove inland from the ring road into the park.</p>

    <p>The only way to get into Þórsmörk is to drive along the riverbed, parallel with the river, which can shift dramatically from season to season.  In places, the river bed can be almost a mile wide, but when we went in the summer, the river itself only took up a small fraction of that (maybe 100-200ft wide or so). The tricky thing is that there were at least fifteen small waterfalls and tributaries that lead into the main river, and the makeshift road that runs along the river crosses through them.  This meant that only large tour buses with massive wheels or a enterprising group of people in a 4x4 can make it past.  We were in the later camp.</p>

    <p>Sitting shotgun in Elsa's SUV, I watched as she bravely switched on all wheel drive, and expertly analyzed each river crossing, attempting to find the shallowest part of the stream to drive through.  Then, we'd hold on tight and forge our way across the tributaries (some of which were up to 50ft wide).  Even on her SUV, the water rose up to almost cover our wheels at points.  Pretty thrilling!</p>

    <p>From the base camp, we left for a hike up a nearby mountain.  To get there, we had to cross the riverbed on foot, and then hike up the mountain. It didn't take long (only a few hours) to do the whole hike, but the view of the riverbed and glacier was amazing.</p>

Despite being more densely packed with tourists, it was well worth the visit.</p>

    <p>Our last stop on our trip was to northern Iceland, to Mývatn (ME-vaw-tin), which is famous for both beautiful waterfalls and large hot springs.

    <p>My favorite stop in the Mývatn area was at the baths, where the hot pools provided a welcome respite from the wind and spray. This pool also included natural hot showers in the pool, so you could stand up and spray yourself whenever you wanted.</p>

    <p>After all of this, it was finally time to head back to Reykjavík.  But as we began our trip west, I spotted some cows grazing right next to the road.  What happened next was pretty magical.  I got out of the car and walked up to them to take pictures, and they walked right up to me to say hello!</p>

    <p>We stopped along the way back in Akureyri, the fishing port city also famous for viewing the northern lights.  We met up with my cousin Antonía and her mother Sirra-- they are both in the tourism business and know lots about visiting Iceland.  They showed us around the town, and we got lunch at a local café.</p>

    <h3>Closing the loop</h3>
    <p>After several hours of driving, we made it back to Reykjavík, where we spent the night one last time before catching our flight.  However, with a few hours left before leaving, we went out with my cousins to an outdoor farm museum, where they educate visitors about life in rural Iceland.  As a great bookend to the trip, I got more time with them, and learned to weave in the process!</p>
