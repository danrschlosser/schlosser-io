<section class="text">
    <p>For my last spring break in college, I went with some friends to Greece, visiting Athens and Santorini.  It was one of my first times in Europe, and my first time in Greece, and I wasn't disappointed. None of us spoke Greek, so we had to get around using the Internet, Google Translate, and the help of many Athenians. Because we avoided tourist season by visiting in March, it wasn't too crowded.  I can imagine that going in the peak of summer would have been a very different experience.</p>

    <h2>Athens</h2>
    <h3>New Life in an Ancient City </h3>
    <p>We spent most of our trip in Athens. The entire city has a blue-beige color to it, with 1970's white architecture that has lost its color. Visiting the Parthenon and the Acropolis museum are a must in Athens. both were stunning: the Parthenon for its size and history and the Acropolis for its modern aesthetic that somehow fits into such a classical city.</p>

    <p>We also took a trip down the coast to the Temple of Poseidon, which sits on an outcropping on the southern peninsula. We were lucky to have a friend of a friend who was a taxi driver, who was able to help us coordinate transportation around the city. If he hadn't helped us, we might have been stuck in downtown Athens for most of our trip.</p>

    <h2>Santorini</h2>
    <h3>The Most Beautiful Island in the World</h3>
    <p>After spending several days in Athens, we took a day trip to Santorini, a Greek Island known for it's distinctive white architecture. We took the first flight there and the last flight back, which gave us plenty of time to walk around the island and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We walked for about six miles along the mountain / coastal trail from Fira to Oia, stopping for water, pictures, and the occasional donkey.</p>
