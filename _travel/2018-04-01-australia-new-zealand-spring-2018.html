    <p>It's rare that you get the opportunity to travel to the other side of the world.  This past April, I had the opportunity to travel for work to Sydney, Australia. To make better use of the trans-pacific flight, I decided to extend the trip by a week, and visit New Zealand.</p>

    <p>What's better, shortly after making this plan, I found out that my childhood best friend Nathan could also join me on the trip. While I spent a week working in Sydney, he explored the city and surrounding area. We ate dinner together, and wandered around downtown Sydney.</p>

    <h2>Sydney</h2>
    <p>While I'd done my homework on New Zealand, Sydney was another story entirely. For the most part, I played it by ear, taking advice from my local coworkers, and wandering around the city. What we quickly discovered, is that the Australians <em>really</em> know how to run a cafe. More than any other meal, I always looked forward to "brekky."</p>

    <p>Overeagar for nature, we quickly headed to the coast, for the Bondi to Coogee walk. Easily walkable from where we were staying, the coastal path was a great start to our trip.</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>We also explored downtown Sydney: Hyde Park, the Botanical Gardens, and the Sydney Opera House. When I make it back to Australia again, I'll be sure to spend more time in Sydney. I didn't get to see much beyond the top tourist spots and a few neighborhoods. The city is so walkable, and neighborhoods so varied; it definitely merits a longer visit.</p>

    <h2>New Zealand</h2>
    <p>After our quick week in Sydney, we flew into Queenstown, New Zealand. I had a bit of a run-in with the customs agents (there was honey in that gift basket??), but it didn't slow us down for long. </p>

    <p>We hopped in our rental car and hit the road. (The wrong side of the road mind you, so it took me a few minutes to get adjusted.) In a matter of minutes, we were winding our way up the mountain pass on the way to Wanaka. We spent our entire week exploring the many faces of the south island.</p>

    <p>The next day, we started our drive to Lake Tekapo. After only 45 minutes of driving, the landscape had totally transformed. Trees disappeared, replaced by low brush. We couldn't help but stop in Lindis Pass.</p>

    <p>After another hour or so of driving, we arrived at Lake Tekapo. Again, another complete transformation. The scrappy brush grew into taller tufts of grass. Brown became green. Over gentle hills emerged the sprawling body of water.</p>
    <p>I was overwhelmed by the color. Depending on how the sun hit it, Lake Tekapo would glow fluorescent or turquoise, navy or muddy gray. I couldn't help but just stare.</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>We spent the night in Tekapo, and took a risk on a stargazing tour with <a href="https://tekapostargazing.co.nz/">Tekapo Stargazing</a>, which ended up upstaging our day at the lake. Tekapo is a protected dark sky reserve, which means on good nights stargazing there is some of the best on earth. We saw the Milky Way, a handful of planets, more stars than I can describe, and even two other galaxies. The galaxies just appeared as dark masses in the sky; we would have confused them for clouds, if it weren't for the knowledgeable staff. We learned MƒÅori myths, inspired by the southern constellations. At the end of the tour, we got to float on our backs in a heated pool and watch the stars in silence.  While I thought the prices might be a bit steep going in, I'd pay double to go back.</p>

    <p>The next morning, we continued driving north. Our decision to stay overnight in Tekapo meant we had a long day of driving ahead. We would loop around the Souther Alps, up towards Arthur's pass, with the ultimate goal of reaching Fox Glacier by nightfall.</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>Time and time again, New Zealand's landscape demonstrated it's ability to transform. After driving for just a few minutes, I'd look around and find the landscape had completely changed. Just an hour after the greens and blues of Tekapo and the Rakia river, I was suddenly struck by dark gray mountains and bright yellow fields. We couldn't help but pull over again; our long drive would have to wait a few more minutes.</p>

    <p>Determined to make more progress in our trip, we made our way north to Arthur's Pass, a drive known for its own drastic transformation.

    <p>Having finally reached the west side of the island, we began driving south towards Fox Glacier. While it rained in the evening, we were lucky to have great weather during the day.</p>
    <p>We skipped the popular (and expensive) helicopter tours of the glaciers, instead opting to continue our trip south. We planned another ambitious day of driving: We drove for another 10 hours to complete our loop at Lake Wanaka and head through Queenstown to Te Anau, where we spent the night. But a long day of driving didn't preclude a few stops along the way!</p>

    <p>Our next stop was by far our longest, and another example of a whimsical decision paying off fantastically. We were driving south along the coast, and pulled over briefly at a viewpoint. We took a few pictures; nothing much to see. Then, on the way back to the car, I hopped up on a fence to see if I could see over the bushes. I snapped this picture:</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>Our interest was piqued. So we continued driving for a few minutes, spotted a sign for a beach turn-off. We parked our car in the lot, and walked over the sand dune onto the beach. But it wasn't right. This wasn't the beach we saw from the viewpoint. It was a pebble beach, and there were people everywhere.</p>

    <p>We must have missed it. So we turned around, and drove back towards the viewpoint, and to our luck, just half a mile back up the road, there was an unmarked turn-off. Why not? After 300ft of dirt road, the road ended, in the middle of the forest. Having spotted a foot-path leading away from the road, we parked our car.</p>

    <p>Hiking boots and backpacks in tow, we started down the trail. It wasn't 3 minutes before we ran into an obstacle: a small river. Was that a good sign? We slipped off our shoes, and tip-toed our way across.</p>

It gets cold enough in the valley that snow falls overnight, and yet it gets warm enough from the morning sun that the snow will melt quickly after sunrise. The result? We raced the sun north, and got to see yet another awe-inspiring transition in scenery: from morning dew, to snow, and back.</p>

    <p>For our last two days in New Zealand, we booked an overnight cruise in the Doubtful Sound. Less famous than Milford Sound, its more accessible and popular cousin, the Doubtful Sound isn't directly accessible by car. The cruise we booked included a bus from Te Anau to the dock, a water taxi across lake Te Anau, a bus over a mountain pass to Doubtful Sound. From there, we boarded the cruise ship, a small boat, designed for around 50 passengers.</p>

<section class="text">
    <p>We had originally booked the cruise as a way to get away from the more active parts of the trip. No more driving, choosing places to visit, or finding food to eat. We had heard that Doubtful Sound was one of the most peaceful places in all of New Zealand, and so we expected a quiet, relaxing, and reflective overnight. What we didn't expect was to make friends!</p>

    <p>We started chatting with the tour company office, and never really stopped! Nathan and I met two couples: Peter and David and Fran and Anna, as well as Fran and Anna's son: Jeremy. We started talking on the dock while waiting to board, and never really stopped! Over the next 24 hours, we spent almost all of our time with our new crew: sitting together at meals, hanging out on the deck of the boat, and learning about each others lives. It turns out we were all from the states, and Peter and David lived in New York, not far from Nate and me! We didn't just spend time together on the cruise: We've met up since, going out to meals, plays, and more.</p>

    <p>After the sun set, we turned around and headed for more placid waters, to spend the night. We stargazed for a while, and spent the rest of the evening in the dining room, gathered around our now-familiar group table, talking, drinking tea and coffee, and sharing stories. While the beds were tiny, I was more than happy rest well that night. When we woke up, the sun had not risen yet.</p>

    <p>Here, I have to give credit to the tour company for the way they run this cruise. In the morning, we road to a different arm of the sound, with light just creeping over the surrounding mountains. Then, the captain instructed us all to report to the deck of the ship. He said that there was a mandatory activity: we were all to be completely quiet for five full minutes. He would turn off the engine, and the backup generator, to create perfect silence.</p>

    <p>We did exactly this, and waited.</p>

    <p>Over the course of the next five minutes, we all witnessed the sun come over the mountains, and slowly bathe the ship in light. The warmth of the sun, experienced in perfect silence, was an absolute luxury.</p>
