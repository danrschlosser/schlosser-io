<section class="text">
    <p>I've always known that I wanted to visit Peru. Well really, I've always known that I wanted to visit Machu Picchu; I didn't even necessarily know where Machu Picchu was for most of my life, but I knew I wanted to go there. There's something inspirational and magical about the idea of a lost city hidden in the clouds at the top of a mountain. I've always known I've wanted to go there.</p>

    <p>What I didn't know is how fantastic Peruvian food is, or how much history there is in Lima, and in Cusco. When our plane took off from New York towards Lima, I only hoped it wouldn't rain on our day at Machu Picchu.</p>

    <h2>Lima</h2>
    <p>When we arrived in Lima off a red-eye flight, we had some time to kill. Before heading anywhere, we went to Larcomar shopping mall, situated on a cliff looking out on the Pacific Ocean.</p>

    <p>After breakfast, we met up with our friend Anastasia and explored Miraflores, the neighborhood in Lima where we were staying. Between delicious ceviche, beautiful murals, and bold architecture, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed spending time in Lima.</p>

    <h2>Cusco</h2>
    <p>After a few days in Lima, we headed to Cusco. While Lima sits along the coast at sea level, Cusco is up in the Andes mountains at 11,000 feet. At that height, elevation sickness is an unfortunate reality, We spent around three days casually exploring the city, while getting acclimated.</p>

    <p>The city is absolutely beautiful and the food was delicious, although we had to be careful to not try to pack too much into a single day. Even without any serious hikes or physical activity, we found ourselves sick and tired by the end of the day.<p>

    <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
    <p>After spending a few days acclimating in Cusco, we headed to Machu Picchu. We went from Cusco on a guided tour by a company called Llama Path. They were great! We took a bus and then a train from Cusco, and got off the train a few miles before Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of Machu Picchu. From that stop, we started a day-long hike (6 miles, 2,000 feet) along the Inca trail towards Machu Picchu. They also offer a four-day version of this hike, but we only had time for the shorter version.</p>

    <p>Finally, after severals hours and countless steps and slips, we made it to Machu Picchu. By this time, the sun was setting and the site was closed for the day.
